##React Weather App

A basic weather app built in React. It utilizes a React modular component style storing state in container components, which pass down to children presentational components.

It allows the user to input a city, fetches data from the openWeatherMap API and displays the current temperature in that city.

This app is deployed on Heroku at http://intense-earth-19511.herokuapp.com/#/?_k=a06kas (as of 3/5/2017).
